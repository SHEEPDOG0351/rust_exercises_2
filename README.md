Finally, I found a way to learn rust in a way that I like to learn it. Rustlings was too difficult for me for now (will return to it soon).
So this github repo works like this:
1. I go through each section of the rust book one number (meaning unit like 1, 2, 3, etc.) at a time.
2. Then ask chat gpt to generate exercises for me based on that section. It (usually) doesn't give me any starter code, so the answer I usually have to complete from completely nothing.
3. The word_exercises folder is where the chat gpt generated problems are; each folder named what the rust file within's unit is on.

This is my favorite way to learn, as you have no starter code, and have to generate a program using certain tools to have the desired output. I hate having starter code, and spending 10 minutes just reading the rustlings !assert_eq statements just to see what I'm supposed to be creating (as the descriptions are sometimes too vague for me to understand).

I also have exercises from the rust 101 github repo. Which is (I think) 100 exercises, each getting harder and harder (as they work through the rust book the same way we are). I personally just didn't like how these problems have starter code.
