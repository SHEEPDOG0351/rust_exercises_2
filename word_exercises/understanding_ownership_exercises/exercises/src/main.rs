// Write a function named calculate_length that takes a reference to a String (i.e., &String) and returns its length as a usize. 
// In your main function, create a String, pass a reference of it to your function, and print both the original string and its length afterward. 
// This exercise will show that borrowing a value does not transfer its ownership.

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
